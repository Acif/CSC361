(a) The DNS query messages from 192.168.1.100 are recursive queries. 
    This is because the client requests that the resolver (172.16.1.1) fully resolve the domain name on its behalf.

(b) The DNS query messages from 172.16.1.1 are iterative queries. 
    The resolver queries authoritative or upstream servers (142.104.80.2, 142.104.6.1) step by step, without requesting recursion.

(c) Advantages and disadvantages of recursive vs iterative DNS queries:

Recursive Queries:
- Advantages: The client receives a final answer with only one query to the resolver. Simplifies client implementation and can be faster due to caching at the resolver.
- Disadvantages: Puts higher workload on the recursive resolver, which must perform multiple lookups. If the resolver is slow or unavailable, the client cannot resolve names.

Iterative Queries:
- Advantages: Spreads the resolution workload across multiple servers. More control over the resolution process, and authoritative servers handle fewer requests per query.
- Disadvantages: Clients must handle multiple queries and responses, leading to more complexity and potentially longer resolution times without caching.
